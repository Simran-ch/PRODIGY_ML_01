# Prodigy InfoTech Internship Repository

This repository contains tasks completed during my internship at Prodigy InfoTech. Below is a breakdown of the tasks:

## Task 1: Linear Regression for House Price Prediction
This project is part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, where I implemented a machine learning model to predict house prices based on given features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. The project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression for predictive modeling.
<br>
**Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to build a regression model that accurately predicts house prices using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes features such as:
<br>
:) Square Footage
<br>
:) Number of Bedrooms
<br>
:) Number of Bathrooms
<br>
By training a linear regression model, we can identify the relationship between these features and house prices.

**Tools and Libraries Used**
**Python** : For scripting and implementation.
**Google Colab** : For writing and running the code in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

**Libraries** :
*numpy*: For numerical computations.
*pandas*: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
*matplotlib and seaborn*: For data visualization.
*scikit-learn*: For building and evaluating the linear regression model.

**Implementation Steps**

*Data Preprocessing*: 
:) Handled missing values, if any.
:) Performed data exploration and visualization to understand the relationships between features and target values.

*Feature Engineering*:
:) Selected relevant features for the prediction model.

*Model Building*:
:) Implemented a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.

*Evaluation*:
:) Used metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² Score to evaluate model performance.

**Results**
The model successfully captured the relationship between house features and prices.

*Evaluation Metrics*:
R² Score: [0.4559299118872445]
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): [1658324.6001036866]
