This repository contains tasks completed during my internship at Prodigy InfoTech. Below is a breakdown of the tasks:

## Task 1: Linear Regression for House Price Prediction
This project is part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, where I implemented a machine learning model to predict house prices based on given features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. The project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression for predictive modeling.
<br>

**Project Overview :**
<br>
The goal of this project is to build a regression model that accurately predicts house prices using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes features such as:
<br>
:) Square Footage
<br>
:) Number of Bedrooms
<br>
:) Number of Bathrooms
<br>
By training a linear regression model, we can identify the relationship between these features and house prices.
<br>

**Tools Used :**
<br>
**Python** : For scripting and implementation.
<br>
**Google Colab** : For writing and running the code in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
<br>

**Libraries Used** :
<br>
**numpy**: For numerical computations.
<br>
**pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
<br>
**matplotlib**: For data visualization.
<br>
**scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating the linear regression model.
<br>

**Implementation Steps** :
<br>
(1) **Data Preprocessing**: 
<br>
:) Handled missing values, if any.
<br>
:) Performed data exploration and visualization to understand the relationships between features and target values.
<br>

(2) **Feature Engineering**:
<br>
:) Selected relevant features for the prediction model.
<br>

(3) **Model Building**:
:) Implemented a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.
<br>

(4) **Evaluation**:
<br>
:) Used metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R² Score to evaluate model performance.
<br>

**Results**:
<br>
The model successfully captured the relationship between house features and prices.
<br>

**Evaluation Metrics**:
<br>
**R² Score**: [0.4559299118872445]
<br>
**Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: [1658324.6001036866]
